# Snake Game with webcam controls

TLDR: Use your webcam to control the snake in the game snake.

[Demo](http://smpurkis.github.io/motion_controlled_snake)

This is an implementation of the classic snake game, except with the controls of using whatever webcam image you wish.

This is part of me learning JS, React and Tensorflow JS, so the code isn't the best, it uses too much memory currently, and can be a bit inaccurate if the images are too similar.

TODO:
- Finish this README
- Reorder, potentially remove React reliance
- Consume less memory
